 1. Using one of the sources in the [ML learning guide](../readings/ml.html),
    read about structures, signatures, and matching.  Then answer
    questions about the structure and signature below.

    The following structure contains definitions that should be
    familiar from the [ML homework](ml.html) and from code you may
    have seen in the course interpreters:

        structure ExposedEnv = struct
          type name   = string
          type 'a env = (name * 'a) list
          exception NotFound of name
          val emptyEnv = []

          fun lookup (name, [])              = raise NotFound name
            | lookup (name, (x, v) :: pairs) =
                if x = name then v else lookup (name, pairs)

          fun bindVar (name, value, env) = (name, value) :: env
        end

    Here is a signature:

        signature ENV = sig
          type name = string
          type 'a env
          val emptyEnv : 'a env
          val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
          val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
        end

    Answer these questions:

    (a) Does the structure match the signature?  That is, if we write

            structure Env :> ENV = ExposedEnv

        does the resulting code typecheck?  Please answer yes or no.

        Yes

    (b) Does the signature expose enough information for us to write
        the following function?  Please answer yes or no.

            fun extendEnv (names, vals, rho) =
              ListPair.foldrEq Env.bindVar rho (names, vals)

              Yes

    (c) Does the signature expose enough information for us to write
        the following function?  Please answer yes or no.

            fun isBound (name, rho) = (Env.lookup (name,rho) ; true) 
                                      handle Env.NotFound _ => false

            No

    (d) If in part (b) or part (c), it is not possible to write the
        function given, change the signature to make it possible.
        If necessary, please copy, paste, and edit your new version in
        here: 


        signature ENV = sig
          type name = string
          type 'a env
          exception NotFound of name
          val emptyEnv : 'a env
          val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
          val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
        end



    (e) Suppose I change the `ENV` signature to make the `name` type
        abstract, so the code reads

            signature ENV' = sig
              type name
              type 'a env
              val emptyEnv : 'a env
              val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
              val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
            end
            structure Env' :> ENV' = ExposedEnv

        The new structure `Env'`, sealed with signature `ENV'`, is useless.
        Please explain *why* it is useless:

        This new structure is useless because the user does not know how to 
        create a name with the signature ENV'.


    *You now have the basic ideas needed to understand what is being
    asked of you in this assignment, and you know enough to implement
    most of the "take the last coin" game ([exercise C](#coins)).*


 2. An ML _functor_ is a function that operates on the module level.
    Think of it as a "module in waiting" or a "module builder."
    A functor's _formal_ parameters, if any, are specified by a
    _sequence of declarations_, and its _actual_ parameters are given
    by a _sequence of definitions_.  A functor's _result_ is a
    structure.  Read about functors in Harper, as recommended in the
    ML learning guide, then answer the questions below.
    
    Here's a typical application of functors.  To keep track of the
    thousands of tests we run on students' code, I need an efficient
    "test set" data structure.  But not all tests have the same type.
    To reuse the data structure with tests of different types, I need
    a functor.  Here is what my "test set" functor needs to know about
    a test:

       - A string identifying the student who wrote it
       - A comparison function that provides a total order on tests
       - A function that converts a test to a string, for printing

    Using this information, answer parts (a) and (b):

    (a) Write down the information needed for a test set in the form of
        _formal parameters_ for the functor `TestSetFun`, keeping in mind
        that a functor's formal parameters are written as a sequence of
        declarations:
        
        
            signature TEST_DATA = sig
                type test
                val name : string
                val compare : test * test -> order
                val toString : test -> string
   
            functor TestSetFun( structure TestData : TEST_DATA)
                :> TEST_SET where type test = TestData.test 
                = struct ... end  (* ignore this part *)
   
        The formal parameters must include a declaration that
        specifies the type of a test, plus enough operations to
        provide the information needed above.
   
    (b) Now focus your attention on one particular test, the `check-type`
        test. Its representation given by these definitions:

            type uid = string
            type check_type_test = 
              uid * int * exp * ty  (* int is sequence number *)
                
        The actual parameters to `TestSetFun` must give `check_type_test`
        as the type of test, and they must provide the operations
        specified by the formal parameters.  Show how to create a set
        of `check-type` tests by filling in the _actual parameters_
        for the `TestSetFun` functor:

            structure CheckTypeSet :> TEST_SET where type test = check_type_test
              =
            TestSetFun(
                       ... fill in definitions here ...
                      )


        The important part here is knowing what definitions to write
        as actual parameters.  The actual parameters must define all
        the types and the operations expected as formal parameters.
        You may also include as many *extra* definitions as you
        like---extra definitions are ignored.  Here are some useful
        extra definitions:

            fun uid          (u, _, _, _) = u
            fun serialNumber (_, k, _, _) = k
            fun exp          (_, _, e, _) = e
            fun ty           (_, _, _, t) = t

        When writing your the required definitions, feel free to use
        these code snippets:
                
          - For comparison,

                case String.compare (uid1, uid2)
                  of EQUAL => Int.compare (seqno1, seqno2)
                   | diff  => diff

          - For string conversion,

                concat ["(check-type ", expString e, " " , tyString tau, ")"]

            Assume that functions `expString` and `tyString` are given.


        Please write your answer above where it says to fill in the
        definitions. 

    *You now understand functors well enough to use them in exercises I and A.*

 3. Read about "signature refinement or specialization" in the
    [ML learning guide](../readings/ml.pdf).  Now,

    (a) Explain what, in part (b) of the previous question, is going
        on with the `where type` syntax.
        
        This syntax patches the signature TEST_SET by specifying the identity of
        the abstract type "test".

    (b) Explain what would go wrong if we wrote this code instead:

            structure CheckTypeSet :> TEST_SET = TestSetFun(...)
            
            The type test would not be defined in the resulting TEST_SET,
            so there is no way to know how to use that test.


    You now know how to refine the result signature of your Abstract
    Game Solver in exercise A.


 4. Read about abstraction functions and invariants in the handout
    ["Program Design withAbstract Data Types"](../handouts/adtproofs.pdf).
    Then, from the ML homework, review the algebraic data type from
    the [natural-number problems](./ml.html#nat), and review the 
    [list-with-finger](./ml.html#finger) abstraction.

    Now answer these questions:
    
    (a) The handout describes a sorted list as one possible
        representation for a set.  Define a function `invariant` that
        takes as argument a list of integers and returns a Boolean
        saying if the list is sorted in strictly ascending order
        (that is, increasing, with no repeats).  You may use ML or
        Î¼Scheme, and you may reuse any function assigned for homework
        this term:
        
        fun invariant (x::nil) = true
          | invariant (x::xs) = if (x <= (hd xs)) then invariant(xs) else false
        

    (b) In the ML homework, the algebraic type `nat` satisfies two
        invariants.  In ML, define a function `invariant` of type
        `nat -> bool`, which returns true if and only if the given
        representation satisfies both invariants:
        
        fun invariant (ZERO) = true
          | invariant (TIMES10PLUS(m, d)) = if not(m = 0 andalso d = 0) 
                                            then if (d < 10 andalso d >= 0)
                                                 then true else false
                                            else false
    

    (c) In the ML homework, the `'a flist` represents an abstraction
        "list with finger."  I ask you to pretend that this
        abstraction is a value of type `'a fingered list`, where
        exactly one element is fingered, and `fingered` is defined by
        
            datatype 'a fingered
              = FINGERED   of 'a
              | UNFINGERED of 'a

        Using your chosen representation of `'a flist`, or, if you did
        not complete the problem, the representation from the model
        solutions, define an ML function `absfun` of type
        `'a flist -> 'a fingered list`, which acts as the abstraction
        function for the list with finger.  This function acts as the
        $\mathcal A$ function from the handout:
        
        fun absfun(FLIST(left, finger, right)) = 
                    reverse (map (fn(x) => UNFINGERED(x)) left) @ 
                      (FINGERED(finger) :: (map (fn(x) => UNFINGERED(x)) right))


    *You are now ready to write abstraction functions and invariants
    in exercises I, N, C, and ADT.*

 5. Read about short division starting on page 734 of the book,
    and in ["Mastering Multiprecision Arithmetic"](../readings/arithmetic.pdf).

    (a) Divide 2918 by 7, calculating both quotient and remainder.  
        At each step, you divide a two-digit number by 7.  The
        remainder is passed along to form the next two-digit number.

              _________
            7 | 2 9 1 8

        At each step of the computation, you will take a two-digit
        dividend, divide by 7, and give quotient and remainder.
        The first step is

              02 divided by 7  ==  0 remainder 2
              29 divided by 7  ==  4 remainder 1
              11 divided by 7  ==  1 remainder 4
              48 divided by 7  ==  6 remainder 6
              

        There are four steps in total.  Edit the text above to state
        the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder at each step.
        Here, write the final four-digit quotient and the one-digit
        remainder:
        
        Final quotient = 0416, remainder = 6
           
    You are now ready to implement short division on natural numbers
    (for exercise N).


 6. Going back to the same reading, and following the examples in the
    section "Using short division for base conversion," convert a
    number from decimal to binary and another number from decimal to octal.

    (a) Using repeated division by 2, convert decimal 13 to binary.
        The ["Mastering Multiprecision Arithmetic"](../readings/arithmetic.pdf)
        handout shows the form, so please just fill in the right-hand
        sides here: 

              q0 = 6          r0 = 1
              q1 = 3          r1 = 0
              q2 = 1          r2 = 1
              q3 = 0          r3 = 1

        Now write the converted numeral here: 1101

    (b) Using repeated division by 8, convert decimal 25 to octal 31.
        Follow the same model: at each step, give the intermediate
        quotient and remainder, and then form the final quotient by
        reading off the remainders.

        q0 = 3    r0 = 1
        q1 = 0    r1 = 3

        Converted numeral: 31

    *You are now ready to implement the `decimal` operation on natural
    numbers (for exercise N).  This will also enable you to implement
    the `toString` operation on signed integers.*
