How we tested our Bignum code
  To test our Bignum code, we implemented operations one at a time and tested
  each operation fully before moving to the next.  We followed the format of
  the Bignum handout implementing all operations of NatZero, then up top in
  Natural, then the NatNonZero operations.  We compared out outputs to the
  outputs of SmallIntegers in the usmalltalk interpreter.  We also utilized
  the testing methods from the spec on Natural numbers.
